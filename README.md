## Introduction

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that makes use of a binary heap data structure. This repository includes Python code for performing an analysis of the heap construction methods in two scenarios: average-case and worst-case.

The heap construction methods analyzed include:
- Bottom-Up Build Heap
- Top-Down Build Heap

## Usage

To run the code and perform the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heap-sort-analysis.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

4. Run the analysis by executing the `analysis.py` script:

   ```
   python analysis.py
   ```

5. The analysis results will be displayed in the form of plots for both average and worst-case scenarios.

## Functions

The code includes several functions, each serving a specific purpose:

- `heapify`: Maintains the heap property in a max-heap.
- `build_heap_bottom_up`: Creates a max-heap using the bottom-up approach.
- `insert_top_down`: Inserts an element into a max-heap using the top-down approach.
- `build_heap_top_down`: Creates a max-heap using the top-down approach.
- `heap_sort`: Sorts a list using the heap sort algorithm.
- `generate_random_data`: Generates a list of random data.
- `average_case_analysis`: Analyzes the average case performance of the heap construction methods and plots the results.
- `worst_case_analysis`: Analyzes the worst case performance of the heap construction methods and plots the results.

## Average Case Analysis

The `average_case_analysis` function generates random data and measures the average case performance of both heap construction methods. It produces plots illustrating comparisons, assignments, and total operations.

## Worst Case Analysis

The `worst_case_analysis` function analyzes the worst case performance of the heap construction methods. It generates data that represents the worst-case scenario and produces plots for comparisons and assignments in the worst case.
